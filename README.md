# Portfolio (Vite + React + TypeScript)

This repository contains a minimal Material-inspired portfolio built with React + TypeScript and Tailwind.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy

- Vercel: import the repo and set the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `dist`.
- GitHub Pages: run `npm run deploy:gh` (this uses `gh-pages` to publish `dist`).

Notes

- The UI is styled with Tailwind to resemble Material/shadcn style. If you want official `shadcn/ui` components, you can integrate them into `src/components`.
- Replace `your.email@example.com` and resume link with your real info.
